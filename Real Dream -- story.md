## Real Dream

#### Background:

This is a fictional world. The IMC Corporation is a colossal monopolistic entity that controls the world's resources. To combat IMC's overwhelming control, a resistance movement has emerged. You are a special agent of this resistance. Your current mission is to infiltrate an unknown IMC research facility to locate Colonel Anderson, who has gone missing during his mission, and continue investigating the institute.

#### 1. Game Start

I am an agent of the resistance, and I need to carry out my mission as required by my superiors. The mission is to recover the information obtained by another agent, Colonel Anderson, who is currently missing. At the entrance gate, there is an iron door with the IMC logo on it. The door is open, and it seems someone tried to escape. I can choose to enter.

Pushing the door open, I step into the hall. The lighting is dim, and the entire facility seems to have lost power. The hall is littered with corpses, showing signs of a gunfight. Besides the alarm sound, there are no signs of life. Disturbingly, the lower half of a corpse hangs from the ceiling, while the upper half has pierced through the floor to the second floor. I need to find a way to identify this person. I notice a ventilation duct on the ceiling, but it is too high to reach without a tool. 

- A door to the west leads to the office.
- A door to the east leads to the observation room.

#### 2. Finding a Ladder in the Office

I find a bookshelf ladder in the office. There are two doors, one leading north and the other south.

#### 3. Discovering Colonel Anderson

Returning to the hall, I use the ladder to climb to the second floor, where I discover the corpse is Colonel Anderson. On his wrist is an unknown wristband, but it has no power. Nearby, I find a military phone on the floor, which I quickly pick up. The phone contains Anderson's last action logs, showing that after discovering this IMC base and reporting the coordinates to headquarters, Anderson infiltrated the base alone. He acquired a wearable device the base was researching, believed to be an experimental version of a portable temporal weapon developed by IMC. However, he accidentally triggered an alarm and had difficulty combating the enemy. In desperation, he activated the bracelet, and the log cuts off there.

- Mission update: Try to repair the wristband.

#### 4. In the Study Room

In the study room, I find a group photo of the experimental staff. The back of the photo seems to have some text, but it has been erased and is unreadable. Hint: In the past timeline, the text might be visible, containing a password to open the Time Core.

#### 4.2 In the Archive Room

The room is filled with shelves, likely for storing archives. There are signs of burning in a fire pit, indicating that all important documents have been destroyed. No progress here.

- A door to the north leads back to the office.

#### 5. Exploring the Observation Room

Returning to the hall, I enter the observation room through a door. Inside is a glass cage with a naked man muttering to himself. He seems to have experienced explosions and abuse, with scars covering his upper body and face. The dim light makes it hard to see his face. Talking to the man, he warns me to be careful with the device I have and not to try using it as it will bring disaster, the same disaster that befell my colleague. He mentions that the lab might have something to help me use it, but I must keep the power usage to a minimum. He offers to tell me the password to the lab, but I must consider my decisions in the research facility carefully. After agreeing, he gives me the password "7355608" to the lab.

#### 6. Entering the Lab

I use the password to enter the lab, where I find a giant charging device with connectors that fit the bracelet Anderson obtained. However, the facility has no power, and I need to restart the power supply to activate the charging device.

#### 7. Entering the Power Supply Room

In the power supply room, I find a control console that can activate the backup power to restore electricity to the facility. I activate the backup power.

- A door to the south leads back to the lab.
- Another door to the west leads to the Time Core, but it is blocked by debris from an explosion.

#### 8. Returning to the Lab

I return to the lab and place the wristband in the giant charging device for charging. The device emits a white light, and as the light fades, I retrieve the now-charged wristband. Using thewristband, a white light flashes, and I find myself still in the lab, but this time, the giant charging device is gone, replaced by a pile of unassembled parts. I realize I have traveled to the past, during the time when IMC was researching and building the charging device.

#### 9. Returning to the Study Room in the Past

In the past timeline, I pass through the observation room, hall, and office to reach the study room. I pick up the photo and find the Time Core password written on the back. I can also return to the archive room to examine documents that were destroyed in the future. The records reveal:

- The "Real Dream" project is one of IMC's key plans, involving the development of time travel devices to send a select group of individuals back in time, bringing advanced knowledge and technology to strengthen IMC's power and monopoly.

#### 9 archive room

In the past timeline of archive room, I see a part of the archiveï¼š
'Real Dream' is one of IMC's key projects. The plan is to research time travel devices and send a selected group of individuals back in time, bringing advanced knowledge and technology to strengthen IMC's power and monopoly.

#### 10. Choices

**Choice 1:** I can choose to use the time travel device to return to the original timeline, escape the research facility, and report my findings to the resistance.

**Ending 1 - Devil Ending:** The resistance, upon learning this news, publicizes that IMC is researching weapons of mass destruction, leading them to sweep the IMC research facility. They use the time travel device to travel back and eliminate IMC entirely, making the resistance the new dominant group.

**Choice 2:** Continue exploring. Mission update: Destroy the time travel device.

#### 11. Reaching the Time Core

Using the previously obtained password, I enter the Time Core, where an active spherical nuclear reactor roars in the center of the room. I can talk to a scientist here and learn:

- IMC scientists discovered that the sun will explode in 100 years, destroying the entire solar system. Scientists have determined that with the current state of global cooperation, it will be impossible to develop a method to save the world within 200 years. To maintain social stability, IMC has kept the impending doomsday a secret, with only a few knowing about it. IMC plans to increase its monopoly on various industries and concentrate the world's resources to secretly explore ways to save humanity.

#### 12. Final Choice in the Control Center

The path to the control center is destroyed, but I travel to a time when it was not. Entering the control center, I make a decision. I can choose to:

- Stick to the resistance's position: activate the system's self-destruct program and destroy the Time Core.
- Change my stance and help IMC implement the Real Dream plan: replace the IMC scientist and start the Real Dream plan, sending myself 100 years into the past to save humanity.
- Do nothing, letting IMC execute their plan.

**Ending 2:**
You activated the self-destruct program of the research facility. During the explosion, you could only use the wristband to travel through time to escape. Although you successfully transported yourself away, you were affected by the explosion and lost your memory. When you wake up from your coma, you find yourself in a transparent cage, being sent to the observation room...

**Ending 3:**
According to the Real Dream plan, you activated the Time Core, but you set yourself as the target for transportation. 
100 years ago, with your knowledge from the future, you became the leader of IMC, dedicating your life to finding a way to prevent the sun's explosion. 
200 years later, the solar system still exploded. You were not the one who could save humanity.

**Ending 4:**
You chose to do nothing and used the wristband to escape the research facility. 
You reported to the resistance that this research facility was just an ordinary facility, and soon after, you left the resistance. 
Shortly after, IMC successfully launched the Real Dream plan, handing over the future of humanity to IMC.
Although the monopoly of the IMC group made people's lives difficult for 200 years, IMC successfully prevented the sun's explosion.
